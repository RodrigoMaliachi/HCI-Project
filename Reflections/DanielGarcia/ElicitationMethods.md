# Elicitation Methods

The technique used only in the project has been questionnaires. This technique, according to the University of Granada [1], it is a research tool that consists of a series of questions designed to gather information on a specific topic. It can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. The data is analyzed and patterns and trends are identified using statistical techniques for quantitative responses.
First, before talking about the project implementation, the phases considered by the University of Granada [1] are five:

1. Design of questionnaires
2. Administration of questionnaires
3. Selection of participants
4. Validation of results
5. Integration of results into the development process

==Of the five phases, it has been observed that 4 out of 5 were doned in the project.== The validation of results with other research sources was not realize. On the other hand, in participant selection, the demographic profile to realize the questionnaires is determined. The selection of mathematics faculty students was done in an improvised manner, and not with a planned sample.

==The validation of results was realized only for the second survey, where students and the percentages of motivations for seeking psychological help were determined.== In the part of integrating results into the development process, it is evident in the statement of functional and non-functional requirements in the project, where explain about how students prefers some factors which is worrying to them how security and reliability.

==A key improvement that could have significantly enhanced the clarity of the information is to have made at least two questionnaires and an interview at the end.== The first questionnaire would capture information from individuals who have used the psychology service and determine their motivations. The second one would involve closed-ended questions to an even larger sample to quantitatively determine the most common reasons. Finally, the interview would reinforce the information regarding the quality expectations for psychology services or the ideal environment, as well as other relevant information. Although, the aproximately time based of the experience to do three survey was of seven minutes in physical, if we would want to apply three survey required at least 9 hours. All depends of the questions of questionnaires and plus the time of realization of the questionnaires. Imply much time in case of time of student to do this.

# Personas

Taking into account the Olsen's Personas Kit [1], there is a variety of categories to consider when building a "persona". ==In our project, aspects such as user anxieties regarding the consideration of scheduling a psychological appointment were into account, because it requires scheduling taken a psychological appointment in the first place, that is, the need.==

The reasons for considering these two key aspects are to determine, firstly, ==the factor that proposes a person to consider scheduling a psychological appointment, and secondly, the factors in their student life at least to.== This way, it is understood what factors make the person feel more comfortable or how they may influence the decision or making process.

To obtain the key elements of the needs and frustrations of students from the Mathematics Faculty, a survey was carried out to them. Although in my opinion now, the first survey application consisted entirely of predetermined options with reasons that people usually have when scheduling a psychologist appointment, it could have been achieved to conduct a survey to determine the reasons why they would like to deal with a psychologist. Although it can be considered that students may not want to openly admit those issues in a questionnaire.

For the analysis and synthesis of the information gathered from the surveys, it was based on the level of confidence of the students who would use any dating service, as well as the motivations of those who would seek psychological appointments in priority order. With that information, ==a "persona" can be constructed with their anxieties and background to understand what a student would be like.==

In the project, only a constructed one "persona" was made. However, according to the Interaction Design Foundation â€“ IxDF [2] in the "Persona" methodology, it only went as far as establishing the construction and description of personas. ==For our project and the issue around it, constructing scenarios or situations for people could be highly useful to understand how a request for a psychologist appointment would be and the motivation behind it to try to evoke that action in other students.==

The constructed "persona" in the product can be used in usability with the scenarios that could be designed in the second delivery to understand how the person performs the action of making an appointment with the psychologist. For example, if when the user sees a design prototype, they have confidence from the first moment of using the application, measuring that could be done through a one-to-five scale of confidence they possess and the reasons for discontent. This can be considered from the "Persona example" in our project, seeing that the person is perfectionistic; a perfectionistic person is subtle in finding flaws and if they find any, they might distrust with the application.

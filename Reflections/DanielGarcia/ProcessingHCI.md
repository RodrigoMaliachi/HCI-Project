# Processing HCI

According to the Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF)[1], key points of the technique denote the creation of assumptions or hypotheses of a project. The second key point is the creation of a minimum viable product covering all aspects such as emotional design, usability, reliability, and functionality, without being solely focused on functionality. The third point indicates that it is the verification of the hypothesis.

This source was not clear. However, according to Fard[3], Lean UX is simply an iterative cycle with three concepts: Think, Make, and Check. That makes it clearer how it works. First, in the initial part, it talks about the thinking stage, which involves making assumptions and then forming hypotheses.

In this part, it's a phase that has been present since the beginning of the project in formulating a hypothesis. However, according to (IxDF), the importance is stated, for whom it is important, and how it is expected to be achieved. **In our project, we couldn't define a clear way of how we measure or will achieve what we expect to achieve, that is essential for the Check phase to validate our hypothesis if the product is viable.**

Our hypothesis is: “The lack of response to the growing demand for psychological care represents a determining factor in the request for psychological service by UADY students and this makes students more likely to have anxiety or depression.”

According to Fard [3], competitive analysis is discussed, this is information that is relevant for competitive purposes. However, in our project, there is no degree of competition but rather it serves as another supportive method for students. However, he makes an interesting proposal for our case, which involves creating storyboards about how a user would use the psychology service, how they communicate their user experience, motivations, frustrations, etc. However, for our project, there is an aspect where users prefer to maintain their privacy about the process.

Now, considering what is Lean UX, we focus in this first delivery on the Think phase. Thus, considering the authors [1] [3], we have partially completed the formulation of a hypothesis or assumption, the creation of questionnaires for the students, and the analysis of the interview information to generate a persona profile. **However, the hypothesis was not completed as it could not be determined how to achieve it, and the questionnaires could have been improved by first conducting a qualitative interview before making it quantitative.**

Given that the interviews took about four days to complete with an objective sample of 100 students, it turns out to be somewhat beneficial for the values obtained and the percentages. However, there is range for improvement in the interview process regarding the questions. Since the number of students interviewed was enhanced by direct interaction with the students.

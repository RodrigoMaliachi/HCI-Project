UI vs UX

There is a significant difference between UI and UX, according to [1]. The first indicates that UI includes all the elements of a user interface, such as its iconography, typography, basic elements, boxes, buttons, etc. While, UX represents the feeling a user has when interacting with the entire system; it aims for positive satisfaction through very good and intuitive usability.

UX can vary with different people; each person is different, so achieving satisfaction for everyone is complicated. Therefore, it is accompanied by research and analysis of the field of people, as it is easier to please the public if it is more delimited. For this, in the project, theoretically, the research of people turns out to be indicated to obtain the sample of people who are objective.

To make UX meaningful without conducting usability tests on users in a prototype, it turns out that it can be done with people by determining what the objective person is like. **However, the information that the current project doesn't have is that there is no information about which applications people use often or, rather, the interfaces that objective people are used to using. In prototyping, this was considered to potentially result in evaluation outcomes if we want it to be intuitive for users. Therefore, we explored what the person is a student of the faculty, with creative and methodical thinking, perfectionist in various aspects, and someone who wants to maintain their security and must trust the interface at first view.**

Achieving UX can be complicated due to the lack of information about the interfaces that objective users usually use; therefore, the solution was sought to use UI design patterns that are used in mobile applications that are simple and clear to use, as well as other designs such as the psychologist's user profile, which is a design pattern, the map or location that are familiar to the user. **So, UI consists of components and typography that belong to the design pattern, generally Roboto as typography is used.**

**For the next delivery, to determine UX and seek quality improvements in the prototype, there is the option of using a "Thinking Aloud" method to obtain the person's thoughts about the interface and which aspects they feel confident using, as well as which application interfaces they remember or consider secure, so that it can be considered later to improve the prototype.**

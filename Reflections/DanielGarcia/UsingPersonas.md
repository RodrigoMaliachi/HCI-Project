In the prototype, we considered the information obtained from the second survey of the project and the persona generated in the process for various aspects. First, the persona we considered is a student at the faculty. Their profile indicates that they are demanding in their school, creative, sentimental as well as a thinker, introverted, quite perfectionist and methodical. They are someone who must feel secure and confident in the application, so they may withdraw if there is an aspect that emits distrust to the user. In other words, an application with a symmetrical structure, clean in appearance with light colors or white, with aspects of trust such as similarities with UI components of trusted applications that the student uses. **This implies that existing components are used and adapted to the prototype as much as possible, so aspects such as location, psychologist's profile image, initial menu, as well as data registration such as name, age, dates, have patterns or designs of known simplicity, as well as their frequently used typography such as Roboto or Rubik.**

**The disadvantage of this is that since the survey conducted with the small sample of approximately 90 people does not give us the certainty that applications like the interfaces or functionalities that students use inspire confidence in the application, as well as they may appear "intuitive" to the user at first glance because they are familiar with it, except that trust can be obtained from them by the brand or reputation of each one.**

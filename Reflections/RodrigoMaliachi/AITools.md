# AI Tools

A few weeks ago I was having a conversation with a friend about the AIs and he mentionated something that his profesor once told him: "It doesn't matter how good you are using any tool, if you aren't able to make decitions based on arguments, expirence or knowledge to resolve a problem, then the tool is workless".

When the usage and dependency of AI are increased, this will automatically limit the human brainâ€™s thinking capacity. This, as a result, rapidly decreases the thinking capacity of humans. This removes intelligence capacities from humans and makes them more artificial. In addition, so much interaction with technology has pushed us to think like algorithms without understanding. [1]

There is another problem with using a lot the AI tools, and that is we ignore a lot of the process behind of solving some specific problem. We can't, for example, ask an AI to do our taxes or give us a medical diagnosis. In both cases, there are so much knowledge needed to generate a good judgement about what the AI is telling you as the answer, a full degree to be precise.

**We must understand that, like any tool, we first need get some expertice in the subject to be able to use the AI correctly and of course detect when the responses are wrong or perhaps lacking in context. Also, we should not abuse it, because it will not solve any problem, but just fill some information that we are missing for whatever reason. The AIs are helpful but aren't truely experts like a real expert.**

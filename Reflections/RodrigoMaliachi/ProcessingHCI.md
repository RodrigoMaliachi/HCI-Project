# Processing HCI

It's funny, when I started researching about Lean UX methodology, I realized how some of the principles were the ones we were unconsciously using to develop our deliverables. And I don't mean that we didn't have a plan to generate results, but that we didn't know that our actions were related to a methodology.

I think we often start by making assumptions about the problem and the solution, and develop a Project using these inputs. In my experience, the teams I work with seem to adopt the solution as an absolute truth.

Assumptions are our best guess based on what we know today. They are also filled with risk. Your goal as Lean UX practitioners is to reduce risk [1].

**And it's not about being wrong to make assumptions, just understanding that it's a practice that helps us get a better result, and using the result, redirect the project to a viable solution. This is a difficult thing to do when pride and empirical knowledge bias make us ignore the results and even force the answer provided to us to match our way of seeing the ideal product.**

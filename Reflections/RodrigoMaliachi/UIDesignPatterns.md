# UI design patterns

The prototype we intended to create is first of all a mobile app, and the obvious patterns to use was Material Design.

Since the prototype is not complete, there are a lot of flaws that could be fixed in the design. For example, a dialog, which asks about whether to send a request and the button that sends that request, considered a positive action, labels "Continue" instead of something like "Send", which gives less confusion to the user about the action that triggers that button.

What we need to start thinking about is how those designs translate to Apple, and also to a page. **The real problem is making all those screens feel harmonious, and the way to do that is to consult more than one design guide.**

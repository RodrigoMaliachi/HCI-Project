# UI vs UX

What we did in our project was first identify the main problems a student has when trying to get an appointment with a psychologist in the traditional way, and then try to create a product that solves those problems.

**I realized the importance of surveying potential users and interviewing related users. If this were a real project, it would probably take me longer to collect the data, because I think everything we got was only partially true due to our bias as a team believing that we actually knew what problems our users have.**

# Usability vs UX

When I think of usability, I imagine all the perks of selecting one entity over another and how that entity makes a job easier. It also has to do with efficiency and fast response. I wouldn't describe as usable something that isn't quite straightforward when it comes to the task it's supposed to help you with.

User experience is about the usability of products, but its scope is broader. It includes some other aspects related to the moment the user starts the interaction and even before, until the end and after that. It is more about feelings.

Usability answers the question, “Can the user accomplish their goal?” User experience answers the question, “Did the user have as delightful an experience as possible?” [1].

For example, my team and I aim to achieve a product that actually speeds up the time in which a student receives attention and access to a psychology professional. In that sense, we are more focused on the usability of our product, because the research we did was with the intention of understanding what is important to the student when using an app and how that translates into the process of scheduling an appointment. 

We're not even concerned about desirability or adoptability, but that's because our project is in the early stages of development, and I think it's going to raise a lot of questions that we're not going to be able to answer.

That is great example to explain the difference. **Teams start by planning how they are going to make a product valuable to the customer and what is the main purpose of using their solution is. Then, eventually, need to worry about the engagement of the customers, that is when user expirence comes to action. Those are bigger steps and also progressive. In resume, usability it's part of UX.**

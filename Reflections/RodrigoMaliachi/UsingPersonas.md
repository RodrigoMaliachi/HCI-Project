# Using Personas

What we get from using this tools is basically the worries about getting attention from a profesional on mental health and more less a few categories on what the common topics are.

Using those results, some of the screens we generated are about asking some preferences to the user in order to give him some better expirience when suggesting a psychologist. 

I feel that we could use more information on getting to talk with psychologists and the system they use to schedule appointments. **Even so, I started to wondering if it is actually a viable option to produce, maybe what it's really needed is an improvement on the current process that UADY has to provide attention to its students.** But we will only know that if we have done some interviews with some of the psychologists and generated some personas based on the system they use.

**We implement the technique of the better way possible that we consider on that moment. We made two surveys to get to know information about the user related to our project (an application to schedule appointments with psychologists). With the second survey we were able to get to know the percentage of people that would able to use the application, the principals reasons for use it, frequency of use, and main aspects when considering using an application of this type. The number of respondents was calculated according to statistics with 96 responds, we have a significative number, and we can process the results and meet the sample of people to learn more about our user.**
**We consider that we could formulate the questions better, because at the moment to the survey we was more focused on get to know more random data about the user instead of considering how we would use those results to form hypotheses. So at the moment to formulate the hypotheses, we didn't know where start with all the data we recollect.** 

**We realized that we could focus our surveys to get to know the services or products that the user already use to schedule appointments with psychologists, and why. We need too make shorter sprints to advance little by little each week, this will help us to estimate better the time of the process, and make reasonable goals per week**

For start we need to understand what is the traditional model in UX, where we have the requirements and we must produce exactly the requirements state, as fast as we can do it, essentially when we use an agile methodology.
The article A Simple Introduction to Lean UX (2021) says that in agile methodology there’s not enough time to do the delivery with the traditional model in UX. But with some adjustments in the workflow we can do it. Lean methodology centers on user experience aiming to obtain feedback as early as possible so that it can be used to make quick decisions. You are looking to produce changes that improve the product in the here and now for better. 

According A Simple Introduction to Lean UX (2021) on Lean UX we have the concept of assumption. With this concept we are asking for Who are our users? What is the product used for? When is it used? What will be the most important functionality? We could have many responses, and there will help us to made hypothesis.  Based on assumptions, state the belief and why it is important and who it is important to, then we try to prove our hypothesis. If we find that there’s no way to prove our hypothesis we may be heading in the wrong direction because our outcomes are not clearly defined.

In the same way, according A Simple Introduction to Lean UX (2021) we use the concept of MVP. The idea is to build the most basic version of the concept as possible, test it and if there are no valuable results to abandon it. This is exactly that we tried to do on Lean UX.

**On my point of view, this model is so promising, however, this model is more used with agile methodologies, in the same way, whatever the methodology we need to take care of the aspects that aspects that distinguish us as engineers, what would it be to document processes, use metrics for our processes, and in essence think about the code will be read more times than it will be written.**
**We need to analyze the context, because if we talk about an MVP (one of the concepts on which the Lean methodology is based), it is so useful for freelancers and entrepreneurs, and definitely the Lean methodology is for them. But if we talk about a medium or large company, we need to think how to adapt all this concepts (which are ultimately very useful, essentially to obtain user feedback) to our context, and think if is agile methodology  for us.**

**If I talk about my teamwork, I consider that my team is using the Lean methodology because we are centered on knowing the user opinion and receiving feedback from the user, we are using surveys and all the necessary to know the user opinion, and based on the opinion we made assumptions and a hypothesis. Maybe in our team we should think more on our assumptions, and all the possibilities, and focus the surveys directly to make hypotheses. Using this methodology is worth it, if we talk about cost in terms of roles, activities and tasks, we are not too far from the goal, we need to organize out teamwork better, and establish more defined roles, shorter sprints to make them more effective, and quality metrics in our processes.**

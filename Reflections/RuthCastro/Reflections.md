For start we need to understand what is the traditional model in UX, where we have the requirements and we must produce exactly the requirements state, as fast as we can do it, essentially when we use an agile methodology.
The article A Simple Introduction to Lean UX (2021) says that in agile methodology there’s not enough time to do the delivery with the traditional model in UX. But with some adjustments in the workflow we can do it. Lean methodology centers on user experience aiming to obtain feedback as early as possible so that it can be used to make quick decisions. You are looking to produce changes that improve the product in the here and now for better. 

According A Simple Introduction to Lean UX (2021) on Lean UX we have the concept of assumption. With this concept we are asking for Who are our users? What is the product used for? When is it used? What will be the most important functionality? We could have many responses, and there will help us to made hypothesis.  Based on assumptions, state the belief and why it is important and who it is important to, then we try to prove our hypothesis. If we find that there’s no way to prove our hypothesis we may be heading in the wrong direction because our outcomes are not clearly defined.

In the same way, according A Simple Introduction to Lean UX (2021) we use the concept of MVP. The idea is to build the most basic version of the concept as possible, test it and if there are no valuable results to abandon it. This is exactly that we tried to do on Lean UX.

**On my point of view, this model is so promising, however, this model is more used with agile methodologies, in the same way, whatever the methodology we need to take care of the aspects that aspects that distinguish us as engineers, what would it be to document processes, use metrics for our processes, and in essence think about the code will be read more times than it will be written.**
**We need to analyze the context, because if we talk about an MVP (one of the concepts on which the Lean methodology is based), it is so useful for freelancers and entrepreneurs, and definitely the Lean methodology is for them. But if we talk about a medium or large company, we need to think how to adapt all this concepts (which are ultimately very useful, essentially to obtain user feedback) to our context, and think if is agile methodology  for us.**

**If I talk about my teamwork, I consider that my team is using the Lean methodology because we are centered on knowing the user opinion and receiving feedback from the user, we are using surveys and all the necessary to know the user opinion, and based on the opinion we made assumptions and a hypothesis. Maybe in our team we should think more on our assumptions, and all the possibilities, and focus the surveys directly to make hypotheses. Using this methodology is worth it, if we talk about cost in terms of roles, activities and tasks, we are not too far from the goal, we need to organize out teamwork better, and establish more defined roles, shorter sprints to make them more effective, and quality metrics in our processes.**



# UsabilityvsUX

**If we talk about User Experience in my project, I talk about an important element of UX, feedback. Feedback lets the user know what's been processed in the system and what's on the way. An example of good UX in our system could be a notification that must say “your reservation has been made successfully” every time a user makes a reservation.**
On the other hand if we talk about usability  Prieto E. (2023) suggest strategies for manage usability, like order the information, offer a simple interaction, foresee the problems, avoid saturation, take the user to action, maintain visual consistency, and indicate the route to follow in navigation. **Specifically in my project to indicate the route to follow in navigation, first is the register where we indicate our address and the things we want to trait, then we show on the screen the psychologists nearby and his specialties, the user must choose one and then choose an schedule with date and time on the available schedule of the month, following that way until an appointment is made. And that's an example of usability.**

# ElicitationMethods

**We implement the technique of the better way possible that we consider on that moment. We made two surveys to get to know information about the user related to our project (an application to schedule appointments with psychologists). With the second survey we were able to get to know the percentage of people that would able to use the application, the principals reasons for use it, frequency of use, and main aspects when considering using an application of this type. The number of respondents was calculated according to statistics with 96 responds, we have a significative number, and we can process the results and meet the sample of people to learn more about our user.
We consider that we could formulate the questions better, because at the moment to the survey we was more focused on get to know more random data about the user instead of considering how we would use those results to form hypotheses. So at the moment to formulate the hypotheses, we didn't know where start with all the data we recollect. 

We realized that we could focus our surveys to get to know the services or products that the user already use to schedule appointments with psychologists, and why. We need too make shorter sprints to advance little by little each week, this will help us to estimate better the time of the process, and make reasonable goals per week**




# Personas

**In our compilation of information we have interviewed to the to the person in charge of psychological services and the faculty psychologist to evaluate the service and the latent need for optimal psychological attention, according the toolkit they would be domain experts, who can often identify what might be valuable to users Olsen G. (2004), so they tell us about the situation of the psychological service on the school, we also use surveys**, according to Olsen G. (2004) that would be deliver data from customer feedback forms, **mostly with the surveys we have been able to know the needs from our user. For analyze and synthetize the data we have use statistics. We evaluate the percentage of user that they tend to have certain psychological problems and the most alarming ones.**


**If we focus on the specific public of users that we have, we could solve his specifics needs, for example, for UADY students from FMAT people, mostly introverted and male, almost 50% of the population has requested the option of online sessions within the platform. With people modeling, knowing that they are introverts, we can conclude based on our research that they will do online sessions.**

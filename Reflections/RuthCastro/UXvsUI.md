# UX vs UI


This concepts are frequently misused, they go hand in hand, but are totally different at the same time. If we talk about User Experience, in this case we could talk about a path to follow at the time the user is interacting with the app, has to do with customer satisfaction and happiness at the moment of using the application. If the customer accesses the application and can follow a path in the use of the application successfully, without difficulties with a positive experience, we have a good UX.
**In the case of my project, when accessing a psychological dating application for FMAT students, there should be the options to access as a guest or register (generating a sense of control in the user), when registering, the user enters their data, name , direction, career, after that areas of specialty are suggested with the psychologists and the user selects the ones of their preference, in each step the option to continue with the appointment or return to the menu is shown, when continuing they choose the modality, they are shown the psychologists and schedules available with the required specialty areas and close to the user's location, the user chooses the psychologist and schedule of his or her preference, clicks on book and at the end the appointment will have been scheduled and the day, time, place, psychologist and date of appointment. All this with good aesthetic design of the application using an UX standard, responsive, user customization and positive experience when making an appointment with a mobile emoji.**

If we talk about the User Interface, we refer more specifically to the elements that make up the application. If there is clarity, cleanliness, consistency of graphic elements, speed, ease and intuitiveness, there is a good UI.
**If we talk about my project, we can mention that the same calendar and clock icon will be used when choosing the date and time of an appointment, the 16 pixel Roboto font will be used for all appointment selection buttons, surveys, start session and all available options; The design must be flexible on different mobile devices, and available for Android or IOS. All this with good aesthetic design of the application using the ISO 9241  UX standard.**

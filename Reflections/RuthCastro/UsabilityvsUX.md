# UsabilityvsUX

**If we talk about User Experience in my project, I talk about an important element of UX, feedback. Feedback lets the user know what's been processed in the system and what's on the way. An example of good UX in our system could be a notification that must say “your reservation has been made successfully” every time a user makes a reservation.**
On the other hand if we talk about usability  Prieto E. (2023) suggest strategies for manage usability, like order the information, offer a simple interaction, foresee the problems, avoid saturation, take the user to action, maintain visual consistency, and indicate the route to follow in navigation. **Specifically in my project to indicate the route to follow in navigation, first is the register where we indicate our address and the things we want to trait, then we show on the screen the psychologists nearby and his specialties, the user must choose one and then choose an schedule with date and time on the available schedule of the month, following that way until an appointment is made. And that's an example of usability.**
